        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy omelet-in-a-bag recipe is great for when there are picky eaters in the crowd who want different egg additions. You can make as many as needed or just one if you like. Got this from an internet friend. Good served with fruit and coffee cake.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices ham, chopped (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh tomato (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 fresh mushrooms, sliced (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped onion (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped green bell pepper (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chunky salsa (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into a large resealable freezer bag. Press out most of the air, and seal. Shake or squeeze to beat the eggs.</li>
            <li>Open the bag, and add ham, Cheddar, tomato, mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and salsa. Squeeze out as much of the air as you can and seal the bag again.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the bag (up to 8 bags at a time) into the boiling water. Cook for exactly 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>Open the bag, and let the omelet roll out onto a plate. The omelet should roll out easily.</li>
        </ol>
